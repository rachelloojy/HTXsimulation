# HTX Hospital Emergency Department (ED) Simulation Problem
This is a simulation exercise to model a realistic emergency department in a hospital in order to generate improvements to the system capacity. This assessment is for a Data Science position in Home Team Science and Technology Agency (HTX).

## Set Up
HTX Task 1.docx is a writeup on how a simulation model can be used to improve the system and answers Task 1 of the assessment.
HTX Task 2.docx sketchs the process workflow of the hospital system and answers Task 2 of the assessment.
HTX Task 3.ipynb is a Python script of a simulation model algorithm and answers Task 3 of the assessment.
HTX Task 3 writeup.docx is a writeup on the Python script and explains how to interpret the simulation outputs from Task 3.
HTX Task 4.pptx is a PowerPoint presentation presenting insights from the model outputs and answers Task 4 of the assessment.
requirements.txt is a text file to install the required libraries used in HTX Task 3.ipynb script.

## Instructions to run HTX Task 3.ipynb
Run HTX Task 3.ipynb to implement the simulation model and generate the model outputs.
